 `Views` class is now named `ButterKnife`
 
+ * New listeners! `@OnItemClick` for `AdapterView` and `@OnLongClick` for any `View`.
  * New: Views are now only checked to be `null` once if at least one of the fields and/or methods
    lack the `@Optional` annotation.
  * Fix: Do no emit redundant casts to `View` for methods.
