-Sending `GPT4/GPT-3.5 (already grayscale)` dialogue requires sending `Arkose Token` as a parameter. There are currently only three supported solutions.
+Sending `GPT4/GPT-3.5 (already grayscale)/Creating API-Key` dialog requires sending `Arkose Token` as a parameter. There are only two supported solutions for the time being.
 
-1) Using HAR, `ChatGPT` official website sends a `GPT4` session message, and the browser `F12` downloads `https://tcr9i.chat.openai.com/fc/gt2/public_key/35536E1E-65B4-4D96-9D97-6ADB7EFF8147` For the HAR log file of the interface, use the startup parameter `--arkose-chat4-har-file` to specify the HAR file path to use (if the path is not specified, the default path `~/.chat4.openai.com.har` will be used, and updates can be uploaded directly HAR), supports uploading and updating HAR, request path: `/har/upload`, optional upload authentication parameter: `--arkose-har-upload-key`

-2) Use [YesCaptcha](https://yescaptcha.com/i/1Cc5i4)/[CapSolver](https://dashboard.capsolver.com/passport/register?inviteCode=y7CtB_a-3X6d) platform for verification code parsing, start the parameter `--arkose-solver` to select the platform (the default is `YesCaptcha`), `--arkose-solver-key` fill in `Client Key`

-- All three solutions are used, the priority is: `HAR` > `YesCaptcha/CapSolver` > `Arkose Token endpoint`
-- `YesCaptcha/CapSolver` is recommended to be used with HAR. When the verification code is generated, the parser is called for processing. After verification, HAR is more durable.

-> Currently OpenAI has updated that login requires verification of `Arkose Token`. The solution is the same as GPT4. Fill in the startup parameters and specify the HAR file `--arkose-auth-har-file`. If you don't want to upload, you can log in through the browser code, which is not required.
