+Alpine offers a 6 different transition directives for applying classes to various stages of an element's transition from a "hidden" to a "shown" state. These directives work both with `x-show` AND `x-if`.
+
+These behave exactly like VueJs's transition directives, except they have different, more sensible names:
+
+| Directive | Description |
+| --- | --- |
+| `:enter` | Applied during the entire entering phase. |
+| `:enter-start` | Added before element is inserted, removed one frame after element is inserted. |
+| `:enter-end` | Added one frame after element is inserted (at the same time `enter-start` is removed), removed when transition/animation finishes.
+| `:leave` | Applied during the entire leaving phase. |
+| `:leave-start` | Added immediately when a leaving transition is triggered, removed after one frame. |
+| `:leave-end` | Added one frame after a leaving transition is triggered (at the same time `leave-start` is removed), removed when the transition/animation finishes.
