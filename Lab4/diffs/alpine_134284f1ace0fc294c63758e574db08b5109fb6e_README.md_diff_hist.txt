+
+Adding `.prevent` to an event listener will call `preventDefault` on the triggered event. In the above example, this means the checkbox wouldn't actually get checked when a user clicks on it.

+Adding `.stop` to an event listener will call `stopPropagation` on the triggered event. In the above example, this means the "click" event won't bubble from the button to the outer `<div>`. Or in other words, when a user clicks the button, `foo` won't be set to `'bar'`.

+`x-cloak` attributes are removed from elements when Project-X initializes. This is useful for hiding pre-initialized DOM. It's typical to add the following global style for this to work:
+
+```html
+<style>
+    [x-cloak] { display: none; }
+</style>
