-## Example usage of Reqwest from WASM
-
-Install wasm-pack with
-
-    npm install
-
-Then you can build the example locally with:
-
-
-    npm run serve
-
-and then visiting http://localhost:8080 in a browser should run the example!
-
-
-This example is loosely based off of [this example](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/blob/master/examples/fetch/src/lib.rs), an example usage of `fetch` from `wasm-bindgen`.
