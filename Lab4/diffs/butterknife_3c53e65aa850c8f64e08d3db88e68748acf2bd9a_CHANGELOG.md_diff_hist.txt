    a list.
+ * New listeners!
+   * `ViewPager`: `@OnPageChange`.
+   * `AdapterView`: `@OnItemSelected`.
+   * `TextView`: `@OnTextChanged`.
+ * New: Multi-method listener support. Specify a `callback` argument to choose which method the
+   binding is for.
  * Fix: Support for generic types which are declared with an upper-bound.
  * Fix: Use less sophisticated method injection inspection in the annotation processor. The previous
    method caused problems with some Eclipse configurations.
