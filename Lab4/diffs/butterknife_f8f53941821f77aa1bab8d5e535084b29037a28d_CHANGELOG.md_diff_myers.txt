 Change Log
 ==========
 
-Version 6.0.0 *(In Development)*
---------------------------------
+Version 6.0.0 *(2014-10-27)*
+----------------------------
 
  * New: Listeners can bind to the root view being injected by omitting a view ID on the annotation.
- * Multiple fields binding to the same ID is now considered an error.
+ * New: Exceptions thrown from missing views now include the human-readable ID name (e.g., 'button1').
+ * Specifying multiple fields binding to the same ID is now considered an error.
  * `findById` overload for view lookup on `Dialog` instances.
  * Experimental: Click listeners are now globally debounced per frame. This means that only a single click
    will be processed per frame preventing race conditions due to queued input events.
