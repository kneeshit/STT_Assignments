 Change Log
 ==========
 
+Version 8.3.0 *(2016-08-23)*
+----------------------------
+
+ * New: Support for Jack compiler in application projects.
+ * Fix: Generate ~20% less code and ~40% less methods.
+ * Fix: Allow `@BindView` to reference types which are generated by other annotation processors.
+ * Experimental: The generated view binding class can now be used directly. This allows ProGuard shrinking,
+   optimization, and obfuscation to work without any rules being needed. For a class `Test`, the binding
+   class will be named `Test_ViewBinding`. Calling its constructor will bind the instance passed in, and
+   the create object is also the implementation of `Unbinder` that can be used to unbind the views.
+   Note: The API of this generated code is subject to backwards-incompatible changes until v9.0.

 Version 8.2.1 *(2016-07-11)*
