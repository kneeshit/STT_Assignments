  * New: Lint checks have been ported to UAST and now work on Kotlin code.
  
+ * Helpers such as `apply` have been deprecated on `ButterKnife` and are now available on the `ViewCollections` class.

  * Add support for Android Gradle plugin 3.3 and newer where `R` is no longer generated as Java source. This
