+### Magic Objects/Functions

+---
+
+### `$refs`
+**Example:**
+```html
+<span x-ref="foo">
+
+<button x-on:click="$refs.foo.innerText = 'bar'">
+```
+
+`$refs` is a magic object that can be used to retreive DOM elements marked with `x-ref` inside the component. This is useful when you need to manually manipulate DOM elements.
+
+---
+
+### `$nextTick`
+**Example:**
+```html
+<div x-data="{ fruit: 'apple' }">
+    <button
+        x-on:click="
+            fruit = 'pear';
+            $nextTick(() => { console.log($event.target.innerText) });
+        "
+        x-text="fruit"
+    >
+</div>
+```
+
+`$nextTick` is a magic function that allows you to only execute a given expression AFTER Alpine has made it's reactive DOM updates. This is useful for times you want to interact with the DOM state AFTER it's reflected any data updates you've made.
