+The Status of Python 3
+----------------------
+
+Currently the Python community is in the process of improving libraries to
+support the new iteration of the Python programming language.
+Unfortunately there are a few problems with Python 3, namely the missing
+consent on what WSGI for Python 3 should look like.  These problems are
+partially caused by changes in the language that went unreviewed for too
+long, also partially the ambitions of everyone involved to drive the WSGI
+standard forward.
+
+Because of that we strongly recommend against using Python 3 for web
+development of any kind and wait until the WSGI situation is resolved.
+You will find a couple of frameworks and web libraries on PyPI that claim
+Python 3 support, but this support is based on the broken WSGI
+implementation provided by Python 3.0 and 3.1 which will most likely
+change in the near future.
+
+Werkzeug and Flask will be ported to Python 3 as soon as a solution for
+WSGI is found, and we will provide helpful tips how to upgrade existing
+applications to Python 3.  Until then, we strongly recommend using Python
+2.6 and 2.7 with activated Python 3 warnings during development, as well
+  as the unicode literals `__future__` feature.
