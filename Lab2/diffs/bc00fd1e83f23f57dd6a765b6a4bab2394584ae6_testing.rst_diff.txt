 If you want to test your application with different configurations and
 there does not seem to be a good way to do that, consider switching to
 application factories (see :ref:`app-factories`).

+Keeping the Context Around
+--------------------------
+
+.. versionadded:: 0.4
+
+Sometimes it can be helpful to trigger a regular request but keep the
+context around for a little longer so that additional introspection can
+happen.  With Flask 0.4 this is possible by using the
+:meth:`~flask.Flask.test_client` with a `with` block::
+
+    app = flask.Flask(__name__)
+
+    with app.test_client() as c:
+        rv = c.get('/?foo=42')
+        assert request.args['foo'] == '42'
+
+If you would just be using the :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_client` without
+the `with` block, the `assert` would fail with an error because `request`
+is no longer available (because used outside of an actual request).
+Keep in mind however that :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` functions
+are already called at that point so your database connection and
+everything involved is probably already closed down.
