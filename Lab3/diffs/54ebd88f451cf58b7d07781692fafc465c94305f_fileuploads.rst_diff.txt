 Improving Uploads
 -----------------
 
+.. versionadded:: 0.6

 So how exactly does Flask handle uploads?  Well it will store them in the
 webserver's memory if the files are reasonable small otherwise in a
 temporary location (as returned by :func:`tempfile.gettempdir`).  But how
 do you specify the maximum file size after which an upload is aborted?  By
 default Flask will happily accept file uploads to an unlimited amount of
-memory, but you can limit that by subclassing the request and overriding
-the Werkzeug provided :attr:`~werkzeug.BaseRequest.max_form_memory_size`
-attribute::
+memory, but you can limit that by setting the `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`
+config key::
 
     from flask import Flask, Request
 
-    class LimitedRequest(Request):
-        max_form_memory_size = 16 * 1024 * 1024
-
     app = Flask(__name__)
-    app.request_class = LimitedRequest
+    app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = 16 * 1024 * 1024
 
 The code above will limited the maximum allowed payload to 16 megabytes.
 If a larger file is transmitted, Flask will raise an
 :exc:`~werkzeug.exceptions.RequestEntityTooLarge` exception.
 
+This feature was added in Flask 0.6 but can be achieved in older versions
+as well by subclassing the request object.  For more information on that
+consult the Werkzeug documentation on file handling.
