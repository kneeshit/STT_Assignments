 Welcome to Flask's documentation.  This documentation is divided in
 different parts.  I would suggest to get started with the
-:ref:`installation` and then heading over to the :ref:`quickstart`.  If
-you want to dive into all the internal parts of Flask, check out the
-:ref:`api` documentation.  Common patterns are described in the
+:ref:`installation` and then heading over to the :ref:`quickstart`.
+Besides the quickstart there is also a more detailed :ref:`tutorial` that
+shows how to create a complete (albeit small) application with Flask.  If
+you rather want to dive into all the internal parts of Flask, check out
+the :ref:`api` documentation.  Common patterns are described in the
 :ref:`patterns` section.
